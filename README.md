Apple Reminders - Can create lists of reminders, can organize these reminders by priority

Find My - Track my all listed devices, track other people's locations once granted access

App Idea - A Recycling App. This would be an application that allows users to find recycling locations in their the surrounding area. Furthermore, this app would give them information about recycling tips, like different ways to reuse items, alternatives that are moe eco-friendly etc.
